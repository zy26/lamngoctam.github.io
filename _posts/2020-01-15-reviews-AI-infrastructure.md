## Introduction
Understanding the requirements for different types of AI jobs will help you to better preparing the solid background and skills.

There are five main tasks to develop an AI development life cycles including __Data engineering, Modeling, Development, 
Business analysis and AI infrastructure__.

Performing these tasks will based on six basic roles __Data scientists, Machine learning engineer, Data analyst, 
ML-Software engineering, Machine learning researcher and Software engineer__.

## Specific skills and knowledge
[1] **Data engineering**
- Strong coding and software engineering skills (especially in machine learning skills)
- Know to use database query languages such as __SQL__ and object-oriented programming languages such as __Python, C++, and Java__

[2] **Modeling**
- Language: __Python, R, Matlab, C++, Java__
- Strong foundations in __mathematics, data science, and machine learning__.
- Deep learning skills: computer vision, natural language processing, or speech recognition.

[3] **Deployment**
- Need to write production code, possess strong __back-end engineering skills__ (in Python, Java, C++, and the like)
- Know cloud technologies (for example __AWS, GCP, and Azure__).

[4] **Business analysis**
- Solid background on __mathematics and data science__ for analytics
- Soft-skills: communication skills and business acumen.
- Programming languages: __R, Python, and Tableau__

[5] **AI infrastructure**
- Software engineering skills to write production code 
- Understand cloud technologies.

## Summary

Based on the report from WORKERA - a deeplearning.ai company, the list of the required skills below 
can help you have a good plan to prepare future jobs.

**Machine learning**
- Understanding classic machine learning models (for example, PCA, K-means, K-NNs, SVM, Logistic Regression, Linear
Regression, and Decision Tree learning)
- Methods to train these models (such as initialization, optimization, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning)
- Techniques to strategize machine learning projects.

**Deep learning**
- Understanding classic deep learning models (such as fully connected networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural
networks, and layers)
- Methods to train these models (such as initialization, regularization, optimization, and transfer learning)
- Techniques to strategize deep learning projects.

**Data science**
- Knowing to use probabilities (including distributions, conditional probabilities, independence, Bayes theorem, etc.)
- Statistics (including hypothesis testing, bias/variance tradeoffs, mean, variance, and mode)
- Data analysis (including preprocessing, visualization and metrics such as accuracy, R-squared, residuals, precision, and recall).

**Mathematics**
- Linear algebra (for instance, matrix vector operations, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and combinatorics)
- Calculus (derivatives, integrals,...) 
- Mathematical functions (simple functions, min/max/argmin/argmax, ...).

**Algorithmic coding**
- Understand algorithms written with code, implement classic algorithms like sorting and search.
- Use classic data structures like trees, dictionaries and arrays.

**Software engineering**
- Having ability to use a variety of computer science and software methods such as object-oriented programming, internet
protocols, HTTP requests, agile/scrum methodologies, databases, version control (such as Git), containers, and unit testing.
