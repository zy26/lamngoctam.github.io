### Program self-driving cars with Sebastian Thrun & Mercedes-Benz
Dive head-first into automated-vehicle systems with Sebastian Thrun (founder of Google Self-Driving Car Project), and build real-world projects designed by Mercedes-Benz, Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) and GPU giant NVIDIA.

ESTIMATED TIME: 4 WEEKS- 15 HRS / WEEK


## MODULE 1
__Computer Vision & Lane Detection__
- Start your journey by exploring basic computer vision techniques for finding lanes on the road
- Learn how to calibrate your cameras and use tools like gradient thresholds & color spaces to improve accuracy
- Apply advanced techniques so your algorithm can handle real-world distortions & complexity


## MODULE 2
__Build Neural Networks with NVIDIA & Google__
- Explore the TensorFlow deep learning framework with Vincent Vanhoucke, principal scientist at Google Brain
- Use the famous LeNet neural network architecture with TensorFlow to classify traffic signs
- Scale your model’s training with Keras and data from the real world and Udacity’s simulator

## MODULE 3
__Master Sensor Fusion with Mercedes-Benz__
- See how companies like Mercedes-Benz set up self-driving sensors in their vehicles
- Learn how to use Kalman filters to measure and anticipate the location of objects around your car (including pedestrians!)
- Dive into Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) and build one in C++ capable of handling data from multiple sensors

## MODULE 4
__Introduction to Localization__
- Use localization techniques to determine where your vehicle is in the world with single-digit centimeter-level accuracy
- Learn how to combine probability with sensor data to localize yourself, and get plenty of practice with quizzes and Python exercises
- Explore Bayesian filters and motion models, then apply what you’ve learned to implement a 2D particle filter in C++

## MODULE 5
__Motion & Path Planning in the Real World__
- Apply model-driven & data-driven approaches to predict how other vehicles on the road are going to behave
- Construct a finite state machine to decide which maneuver your vehicle should take for maximum safety
- Finally, generate a safe and comfortable trajectory for executing the maneuver

## MODULE 6
__Programming Controllers for Vehicle Movement__
- Explore the surprising challenges of machine-based movement control with Uber ATG
- Send steering, acceleration, and brake commands using proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers in Python
- Implement a C++-based PID controller in the Udacity Simulator

## MODULE 7
__Put Your Code to the Test (with a Real Car!)__
- Get introduced to Udacity’s self-driving car “Carla,” and the robot operation system that controls her
- Work as a team with other Nanodegree students to build an end-to-end program that will drive Carla safely & successfully
- Test-drive your program “IRL” on the Udacity test track!

## Project: 
- Complete 9 in-depth robotics & AI projects, following cutting-edge industry best practices

To hammer home what you learn, you’ll build, test & implement challenging projects for each milestone in your training. By the time you’re done, you’ll have an impressive technical portfolio you’ll be eager to show potential employers.

### PROJECT 1
__FINDING LANE LINES WITH COMPUTER VISION__
Use features like color selection, region masking & edge detection to identify lane lines on the road.

### PROJECT 2
__LANE FINDING: ADVANCED TECHNIQUES__
Write a software pipeline to identify lane boundaries from a video streaming from a front-facing camera on a car.

### PROJECT 3
__BUILD A TRAFFIC CLASSIFIER WITH NEURAL NETWORKS__
Use what you've learned about deep neural networks & convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs.

### PROJECT 4
__BUILD A BEHAVIORAL CLONING NETWORK__
Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to drive like you in Udacity’s simulator program.

### PROJECT 5
__IMPLEMENT AN EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER IN C++__
Use a Kalman filter, lidar measurements and radar measurements to track a moving bicycle in the simulator.

### PROJECT 6
__BUILD AN END-TO-END LOCALIZER FOR A “STOLEN” VEHICLE__
Implement a 2-dimensional particle filter in C++ and combine it with a map to localize a vehicle!

### PROJECT 7
__DESIGN A PATH PLANNER FOR SAFE HIGHWAY DRIVING__
Build a path planner that creates smooth, safe trajectories to follow on a track with other vehicles, all going different speeds.

### PROJECT 8
__IMPLEMENT A CONTROLLER TO MANEUVER A CAR__
Back to the racetrack simulator! This time you’ll implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the car (at up to 100 mph).

### PROJECT 9
__TEST-DRIVE YOUR CODE ON THE UDACITY TRACK!__
Submit your code to be run on “Carla,” our autonomous Lincoln MKZ, at our test site in Palo Alto, California!
