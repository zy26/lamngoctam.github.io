## Introduction
Python is one of the best language nowadays. We can use Python in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and its applications implement in Data Science, Robotics, etc.
I just collect Python programming resources that can help me on doing research.

## Tutorials
For the basic syntax, we can spend short time to understand them to use in your project.

1. Basic
- [Python Syntax | The Best Tutorial to Learn Python Syntax](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-tutorial/)
- [Python Operators]()
- [Python Functions]()
- [Python Comprehensions]()
- [Python Lists]()
- [Python Tuples]()
- [Python Directory and Dictionary Comprehension]()
- [Decision Making in Python]()
- [Loops in Python]()

2. Libraries
- Numpy
- Pands
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Seaborn

3. Projects
We should start with simple projects within source code to boost the programming skill before starting yoru own projects.
3.1. Colour Detection

In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. Here we are going to use computer vision library of Python that is OpenCV and Pandas.

The Source Code and Steps to implement all the [7 projects is here- Python projects with Source Code](https://sites.google.com/view/learn-python-data-science/python-projects)

3.2. Chatbot - A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human. We are going create a retrieval based chatbot using NLTK, Keras, Python, etc. You can find the source code and complete implementation guide in the link I have shared above.

3.3 Typing Speed Test - In this Python project idea, we are going to build an exciting project through which you can check and even improve your typing speed. For a graphical user interface, we are going to use the pygame library which is used for working with graphics. We will draw the images and text to be displayed on the screen.


3.4. Traffic Signs Recognition - This project might help you to experience what it feels like to work on this dream concept. An autonomous or self-driving car is just a machine that is operating from the inside and making decisions based on the training is received. This project lets you train a system about recognizing all the traffic signs and then making the decisions accordingly.

3.5. Tic Tac Toe Game - Tic Tac Toe is one of the most played games and is the best time killer game. To implement this game, we will use the basic concepts of Python and Pygame which is a Python library for building cross-platform games. It contains the modules needed for computer graphics and sound libraries.
