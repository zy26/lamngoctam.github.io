## Working on Ubuntu bash
- If we do `ls` command, there is nothing here.
- `cd /` then `ls` we can see the root of subsystem. __mnt__ is the C folder of Window
- `cd mnt` - `ls` - `cd C` now we are working on C folder of window
- From `/mnt/c/users/ngoct/Projects` we do `$ sudo apt update` to avoid data corruption if we work on the folder in linux subsystem inside window folder.
- Next is to upgrade `$ sudo apt upgrade`.

## Working on Visual Studio Code on WSL:Ubuntu
- **Install**

  - `tamlam@DESKTOP:/mnt/c/Users/ngoct/Projects/coder$ code.`
  - Create a new file: `touch main.cpp`

- **Setting**

__Ctrl + Shift + P__ in the tab of __c_cpp_properties.json__, change the default setting to __"compilerPath": "/usr/bin/g++"__
