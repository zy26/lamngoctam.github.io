`Waring!` 

This is the first step to build the blog through [github][github] and [Jekyll][jekyll-docs].
This blog was forked from [Minimal Mistakes GitHub Pages][Minimal-Mistakes]
Jekyll can offers powerful support for code snippets which I can show the code within my blog:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tam')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tam' to STDOUT.
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
