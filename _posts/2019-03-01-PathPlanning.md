##Course 6: Path Planning

Path planning routes a vehicle from one point to another, and it handles how to react when emergencies
arise. The Mercedes-Benz Vehicle Intelligence team will take you through the three stages of path
planning. First, you’ll apply model-driven and data-driven approaches to predict how other vehicles on the
road will behave. Then you’ll construct a finite state machine to decide which of several maneuvers your
own vehicle should undertake. Finally, you’ll generate a safe and comfortable trajectory to execute that
maneuver.

Lesson Title Description
1 Search In this lesson you will learn about discrete path planning
and algorithms for solving the path planning problem.
2 Prediction In this lesson you'll learn how to use data from sensor
fusion to generate predictions about the likely behavior of
moving objects.
3 Behavior Planning In this lesson you'll learn how to think about high level
behavior planning in a self-driving car.
4 Trajectory Generation In this lesson, you’ll use C++ and the Eigen linear algebra
library to build candidate trajectories for the vehicle to
follow.
